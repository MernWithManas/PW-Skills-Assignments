        <h1>CSS:</h1>
        <p>CSS, which stands for Cascading Style Sheets, is a fundamental technology that plays a pivotal role in web development. It is used to control the presentation and layout of web pages, allowing developers to apply various styles to HTML elements. CSS enables designers to create visually appealing and consistent user interfaces, making websites more engaging and user-friendly. By specifying attributes such as colors, fonts, margins, and positioning, CSS provides a separation between content and presentation, simplifying the maintenance and updating of websites. Its cascading nature allows styles to be inherited and overridden, offering flexibility and organization in the design process. With CSS, developers can achieve responsive design, ensuring that web pages adapt gracefully to different screen sizes and devices. Overall, CSS is a powerful tool that empowers web developers to transform plain HTML documents into captivating and aesthetically pleasing web experiences.
