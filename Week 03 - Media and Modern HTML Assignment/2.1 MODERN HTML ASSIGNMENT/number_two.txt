No. 02 > HTML ENTITIES: 

                        HTML entities are special codes used in HTML to represent characters that cannot be directly typed using a keyboard or might conflict with the HTML syntax. They are used to display reserved characters, special symbols, and characters with specific meanings in HTML documents.
                        Here are five commonly used HTML entities:

                        &lt;: Represents the less-than sign (<).
                        &gt;: Represents the greater-than sign (>).
                        &amp;: Represents the ampersand symbol (&).
                        &quot;: Represents the double quotation mark (").
                        &nbsp;: Represents a non-breaking space, which prevents the browser from collapsing consecutive spaces into one.
