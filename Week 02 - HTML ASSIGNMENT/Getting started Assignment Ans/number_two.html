    <h1 style="text-align: left;">Odisha: India's best kept secret !</h1>
    <p>
        The ‘soul state’ of Odisha is India’s best kept secret and a hidden gem for travellers planning a visit to India. Odisha’s capital, Bhubaneswar, also referred to as the ‘City of Temples’ for its 7,000+ temples once upon a time, was also named by Mark Twain as one of the wonders of the world. 

Odisha has a wide and unique range of attractions that satisfy the fancy of tourists visiting the state. It offers everything on a platter to anyone visiting- from beaches to hills, sanctuaries to skyscrapers, international cuisine to authentic regional delicacies.
Today, not only India but even the United Nations has lauded the mettle of Odisha for effective management of disaster. Despite facing such natural calamities, I have witnessed the state standing tall, becoming stronger and resilient and carrying on with their daily lives. I can proudly say that my 8 years of stay in Odisha has transformed me into a strong-willed woman with infinite faith in almighty and an indomitable spirit to face any adversities in life. Today, while working for a slow & sustainable Australian fashion brand Ecoloom Pty Ltd, I am still connected to Odisha as I work with Odia artisans who weave natural fabrics and make handmade utility items.</p>
