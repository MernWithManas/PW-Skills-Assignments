Question No. (10) Ans: Global Attributes:

                       Global attributes may be specified on all HTML elements, even those not specified in the standard. That means that any non-standard elements must still permit these attributes, even though using those elements means that the document is no longer HTML5-compliant.
                       
                       For eg. 
                       > accesskey:	Specifies a shortcut key to activate/focus an element

                       > class:	Specifies one or more classnames for an element (refers to a class in a style sheet)
                        
                       > contenteditable:	Specifies whether the content of an element is editable or not
                    
                       > data-*:	Used to store custom data private to the page or application
                       
                       > dir:	Specifies the text direction for the content in an element
