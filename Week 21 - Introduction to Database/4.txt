Q - Explain 5 challenges of file-based storage system which was tackled by dbms.

Data Redundancy:

Challenge in File-Based Systems: In file-based storage, the same data might be duplicated across multiple files, leading to redundancy. If updates are not consistently applied, it can result in inconsistencies and wasted storage space.
DBMS Solution: A relational database management system (RDBMS) addresses this by providing a structured way to organize data with tables and relationships. Redundancy is minimized through normalization, reducing the likelihood of inconsistencies.
Data Isolation:

Challenge in File-Based Systems: Data in file-based systems is often isolated within individual applications, making it challenging to share and maintain a unified view of information across an organization.
DBMS Solution: DBMS facilitates data integration by allowing multiple applications to access the same database. This promotes data consistency and coherence across different parts of an organization.
Data Dependence:

Challenge in File-Based Systems: Changes to the structure of data, such as adding a new field, may require modifications to all programs that use that data, leading to high maintenance costs and increased complexity.
DBMS Solution: DBMS abstracts the physical structure of data from the applications that use it. This reduces data dependence, allowing changes to the database structure without affecting the applications, promoting easier maintenance.
Limited Data Retrieval Capabilities:

Challenge in File-Based Systems: Retrieving specific information from a file-based system can be cumbersome, lacking the efficiency of modern databases' powerful query languages.
DBMS Solution: DBMS provides query languages (e.g., SQL) that enable users to retrieve specific data efficiently. This enhances the ability to search, filter, and extract information based on various criteria.
Concurrency and Data Integrity:

Challenge in File-Based Systems: Simultaneous access by multiple users or applications in file-based systems may result in data corruption or inconsistencies.
DBMS Solution: DBMS employs concurrency control mechanisms to manage simultaneous access, ensuring data integrity. Transactions are processed in a way that maintains the consistency and reliability of the data even in a multi-user environment.
